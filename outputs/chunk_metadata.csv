Issue
BoW may overemphasize common words (i.e. “movie”)

34
TF-IDF
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

TF captures how important a word is to that specific document (more occurrences = more important)
IDF reduces the weight of common words that appear in many documents (i.e. ""movie"")
Words that appear frequently in one document but are rare across all documents get the highest TF-IDF scores",145

[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 


TF-IDF = (number of times word appears in document) x log (total docs/number of docs containing word)

# “Great movie, amazing, amazing plot”
[0, 1.56, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.79, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.48, 0.48, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

“amazing”
TF = appears 2 times
IDF = log(6/1) - appears in ⅙ documents
TF-IDF = 2 x log(6) = ~1.56

“movie”
TF = 1
IDF = log(6/2)
TF-IDF = 1 x log(3) = ~0.48",243

These approaches:
Lose negation (""not good"" counts ""good"" as positive)
Lose word order (""terrible acting but great plot"" might be misclassified)

""movie"": 1
""amazing"": 1
""plot"": 1

how often “deep” appears near “learning”

GloVe factorizes this large co-occurrence matrix into lower-dimensional word vectors.

Final Hidden State
What It Does: Combines previous hidden state and candidate state
How It Works:
zt controls balance between previous (ht-1) and candidate (h̃t) states
If zt close to 1, favors new candidate state
If zt close to 0, keeps more information from previous state
96

GRU
Has 2 gates:
Update gate
Reset gate
No separate cell state
Cell state and hidden state are merged
So GRU is simpler.

They have issues with sequences of different lengths
The size of the network depends on the length of the sequence, so optimization requires a longer time to train and lots of steps
They don’t work well with long text documents
Issues with long-range dependencies
They are hard to train
SLOW: They do not allow for parallel computation (all computation occurs sequentially and therefore cannot be parallelized)
CHALLENGING HYPERPARAMETER TUNING: Lots of parameters that are interlinked with one another
98

RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies because information must pass sequentially through many time steps, and they cannot be parallelized during training. Transformers address these limitations using self-attention, which allows all tokens to interact directly and enables parallel computation.",167

[slides]_i_nlp__c040,[slides]_i_nlp.pptx,slides,40,per_slide,"1️⃣ Handling Variable-Length Sequences
❓ Why do neural networks require special handling for variable-length sequences?
✅ Model Answer (Exam-Ready)
Neural networks require fixed-size inputs for efficient computation and batching. Since text sequences vary in length, they must be padded or packed to ensure consistent tensor dimensions. Without this, batching and parallel processing would not be possible.

🧠 Intuition
Computers work with matrices.If one sentence has 5 words and another has 12, you can’t stack them into the same matrix unless you pad the shorter one.

❓ What are the two main solutions?
✅ Model Answer
The two main approaches are padding and packed sequences. Padding adds special tokens (e.g., <PAD>) to shorter sequences, while packed sequences allow frameworks like PyTorch to process only valid time steps without computing over padding.",200

Data Augmentation
Best Practices:
Ensure augmentations don't change the meaning/label
Apply augmentation equally across classes
Manually check samples of augmented data
Combine methods for better diversity",108
[slides]_i_nlp__c042,[slides]_i_nlp.pptx,slides,42,per_slide,"❓ Why is data augmentation harder in NLP than in computer vision?
✅ Model Answer
Text augmentation is harder because small changes to words can alter meaning or label. Unlike images where flipping or rotating preserves semantics, replacing or deleting words in text may change sentiment or intent.

🧠 Intuition
Changing one word in text can completely reverse meaning:“good” → “not good”
That’s why augmentation must be careful.

❓ Name common text augmentation techniques.
✅ Model Answer
Common techniques include back-translation, synonym replacement, random insertion, random deletion, and random word swapping. Back-translation is often most reliable because it preserves semantic meaning.",157

[slides]_i_nlp__c044,[slides]_i_nlp.pptx,slides,44,per_slide,"❓ Why is class imbalance a serious issue in NLP?
✅ Model Answer
In imbalanced datasets, models tend to favor the majority class, leading to poor performance on minority classes. This results in misleading accuracy scores and poor real-world generalization.

❓ How can we handle imbalance?
✅ Model Answer
Imbalance can be addressed through sampling techniques (oversampling/undersampling), modifying the loss function using class weights, or using ensemble methods trained on balanced subsets.

111
Data Splitting Best Practices
Challenges:

Temporal dependencies in text data
News articles should be split by date
Social media conversations need chronological splits
Cross-contamination between splits
Similar documents may appear across splits
Duplicate or near-duplicate content",169
[slides]_i_nlp__c045,[slides]_i_nlp.pptx,slides,45,per_slide,"112
Data Splitting Best Practices
Split by document source/author when possible
Prevents data leakage from writing style
Important for authorship attribution tasks
Maintain similar topic distributions across splits
Account for domain shift between train/val/test
Conversation data
Split by conversation thread, not individual messages
Keep context-reply pairs together
Sequential data
Time-based splits for forecasting tasks

❓ Why is random splitting sometimes dangerous in NLP?
✅ Model Answer
Random splitting can cause data leakage when similar or duplicate documents appear across train and test sets. This leads to overly optimistic evaluation results.

❓ What is best practice for splitting sequential or conversational data?
✅ Model Answer
Sequential data should be split chronologically to prevent future information from leaking into training. Conversation data should be split by entire threads rather than individual messages.",182

Transfer Learning / FT
Gradual Unfreezing

Process:
Start with all layers frozen except final layer
Train for N epochs
Unfreeze next layer
Repeat until desired depth

Benefits:
Prevents sudden changes to pretrained weights

Reduces overfitting risk",142
[slides]_i_nlp__c047,[slides]_i_nlp.pptx,slides,47,per_slide,"❓ What is the difference between full fine-tuning and frozen backbone?
✅ Model Answer
Full fine-tuning updates all model parameters, while frozen backbone training keeps pretrained layers fixed and only trains task-specific layers. Freezing reduces overfitting and computational cost.

❓ What is gradual unfreezing?
✅ Model Answer
Gradual unfreezing involves training the final layer first, then progressively unfreezing earlier layers. This prevents sudden disruption of pretrained weights and stabilizes training.

Self Attention v. Cross Attention
Self attention operates within a single sequence.

[slides]_ii_nlp__c013,[slides]_ii_nlp.pptx,slides,13,per_slide,"27
Cross Attention
For each element in one sequence (query sequence), cross-attention computes attention scores based on its relationship with every element in the other sequence (key-value sequence)

Each decoder layer has a self attention mechanism, but it is masked to prevent tokens from attending to future tokens in sequence
In encoder-decoder models, the decoder also has cross-attention layers that allow it to attend to the output of the encoder layers

In the context of ""The sunset is orange,"" the embedding for ""orange"" would be closer to color-related terms or descriptions of nature 🟧 🌅 🌈 
Inference
At inference time, when a model encounters the word ""orange,"" it doesn't rely on a predetermined static vector. 
Rather, it dynamically generates an embedding for ""orange"" by considering the entire sentence or surrounding text. 
Attention allows it to weigh the relevance of each surrounding word to determine the most appropriate meaning of ""orange"" in that specific context.

Token Limits
Theoretically there is not a token limit.
The complexity of calculating attention scores is quadratic (O(n2)) with respect to the sequence of length n. 
Computation & Memory
Gradients calculated over long sequences may become less meaningful
Training is less efficient on long sequences
Batch size and sequence length directly affect memory required during training (to maintain manageable memory, there is a tradeoff between batch size and max token limit)
Optimizations to increase token limits:
Sparse attention patterns (i.e. Longformer, BigBird)
Techniques like gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training to manage memory more efficiently

Text Summarization
Extractive Example
TextRank uses an unsupervised graph-based approach to identifying and extracting the most “central” sentences in a document

Text Summarization
Abstractive Example
We can use transformer models pre-trained on a summarization dataset or train them ourselves
Note that larger documents must be broken into sequences with a max length dictated by the model architecture",190

Topic Modeling
Can be useful to “tag” documents based on topics or attributes
Applications:
Auto-tagging of web articles
Unsupervised document classification
Identifying attributes in product reviews
Auto-tagging customer support tickets

Topic Modeling
Methods
Supervised - if sufficient labeled training data is available
Unsupervised -
[Traditional] Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
[Traditional] Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Transformer embeddings

62
Topic Modeling
Could assume the topic’s keywords are contained in the document
Which words are the right keywords?
Compare the encoding of each word in the document to the overall document encoding
Words with closest embedding to document (based on cosine similarity) are probably the keywords

Dimensionality Reduction
PCA
Focus is on capturing global linear relationships in the data
Use to: simplify and find global linear relationships and patterns in the data
t-SNE
Constructs a lower-dimensional representation where similar data points are placed closer together
Use to: Emphasize visualization, reveal local patterns and clusters
UMAP
Uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to understand the underlying structure or shape of the data
Focus on capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data 
Use to: preserve local structure and handle complex, nonlinear relationships

Mixture of Experts
In traditional transformers, all parameters are used for every input, but MoE models only activate a small subset of parameters (the ""experts"") for each input token
Instead of the dense FFN, MoE layers have a certain number of “Experts” where each expert is a NN (any NN!)
There is also a router network, composed of learned parameters and trained at the same time as the network

This announcement was very long, and the whole idea was, did you read it to get to this part? So you will get a version that is an animal. And so the animal draw lemur.

Those who read emails in this class tend to do better on the exams. The next thing was does order matter? Or does the time you spend on the exam correlate with grade outcomes? It's always very curious to me because some people come up here and they're done immediately, and then other people take their time.

I didn't want to out people, but the people who participated in the Society Center de hackathon in some way, they're volunteering or competing. Those people did better on the assessment, even if you didn't count those ten points. So that involvement, you know, it makes you more well-rounded and better able to think about some of these questions. Also, one note here is that if you get 100 on this exam, you're not optimizing your time here. Frankly, you're spending too much time studying okay. So if you're one of those people who got close to 100%, you can spend less time studying and more time doing something else that would be beneficial to your career.",175

So E2 to 88, if you're in that range, you got a really, really good grade on this first exam. You knew the material well enough, but you didn't over study. So you optimize your time very well. Okay. So in light of grades being for feedback, if you go back through your module assessment and rewrite your incorrect answers, I will give you half credit for that.

If you want to argue about points on your exam or project, you will forfeit the opportunity to get half credit back. Not going to, because I'm going to be spending a lot of time going back through and checking all of these, and so I don't want to spend that time then also argue with you about a few points. So I'm giving you this opportunity. But if you want to argue that it's really fine, you're going to forfeit your points. All right? Yes.

The tokenizer model comes here and we see each of these individually is then uh given a token uh because we're splitting based on whitespace and punctuation.

So for you all, you're probably going to be working with some kind of pre-trained model. And so you're going to want to use their tokenizer. You're probably not going to have to create your own tokenizer from scratch if you're using a pre-trained approach. Um, you're going to use uh, one of their tokenizer.

And if you look in the undoubted corpus um these are all of the English stopwords. So you can see words like when we're into just don't show. Now these are all stopwords. Um, for the Nltk corpus.

This is going to reduce fruits to their stem. This is the part to which we add a suffix even if the stem is not an actual work. So important note for study. It's crude. Um, and it is fast. And then we have lemmatization. This is slower, but it's usually better. We're going to reduce the words to a normalized form through a mapping dictionary.

So let's talk about a couple of ways to do traditional natural language processing without using neural networks. So the simplest approach is back and forth.

Like they have the word movie in them. And so these common words that don't really matter to the overall sentiment can get overemphasized.

We've got one. Ah great movie. And then plot. Okay. So for tf IDF here's an example. So my TF term frequency. This is our bag of words right. It appears two times.

We used to capture sequences of words. So we can do unigram. These are regular bag of words where we have one word. But then we have bigrams.

So hidden Markov models based on Markov chains. Here is an example of a Markov chain where depending on the day. So this is a cloudy day rainy day or sunny day. What's the probability of what the weather is going to be that next day. So if it's sunny today there's a 50% chance it'll be sunny tomorrow. A 10% chance that it'll be rainy tomorrow, and a 40% chance that it'll be cloudy tomorrow and then cloudy. Right? 10% chance that it'll be cloudy tomorrow. If it's partly cloudy today, a 50% chance it'll rain and a 40% chance that it'll be sunny. So to predict tomorrow's weather, we need to know the probability of each possible sequence. Right? Um, so let's simplify it and just do ratings done here.",189

So we're going to collect data and look at sunny days and rainy days and these transition states. And now we can look at our transitions. So if we look at the amount of time to go from sun to sun this is seven. We look at the amount of time to go from sun to rain to room to rain. So to rain that is three. We look at how many times we go from rain to sun, rain to some sun. That's two. And how many times you go from rain to rain? That's three. So two out of five is point four.",186

And if you look over here in the rainy category, it is 8.4 chance it will be sunny to that and 2.6 chance that it is going to be rainy again tomorrow. So this is how we construct Markov chains. But we can't always directly measure our observations. Sometimes we have to infer them from other variables. This happens a lot in real life, but we can't just make the observations or cells. And so what we end up doing is we have our observations. And then we have our Markov chain which is going to be unobserved.",188

So we don't know what the weather is there, but we're trying to model it. But we can't observe our friend's emotional state. So our friend calls us and we can observe their emotional state to see what the weather is. So we don't know the weather, but we can observe our friend's emotional state.

Well what would that do to your computational load resources. 470,000 turn vector when most of them are zero and only a few are ones. Probably wouldn't do so great. There's the answer.

So here we capture semantic relationships make it possible for word with similar meanings to have similar representations. This allows us to do dimensionality reduction.

So again, using chain rule, doing all of the things that we did in backpropagation. But now we're computing the loss across all of the time steps of our particular sequence. Now there's a little bit of a challenge with recurrent neural networks, and that is that for longer sequences, the chain can get very long and the gradient can get very close to zero.

And our hyperbolic tangent layer generates new candidate values to be possibly added to the memory. So which values do we update? And what are the new candidate values. C tilde a sub t. Okay.

And this allows us to do is update ourselves memory with new information and remove unnecessary information. So we multiply all the information by R for Kincaid's output to remove unwanted data.

Uh, a lot of you had to do that for your computer vision projects. You probably have to do for NLP as well. We're gonna talk about data splitting, best practices, transfer learning and fine tuning. And then we're I'll just touch on a couple of popular NLP libraries questions before we jump into implementation. All righty then. So we got variable length sequences right. So this is really tricky.

So natural text has very light and neural networks. Of course we know they need fixed size inputs. Right. That's why we always had images that were the same size. Uh, batching requires consistent dimensions. This makes it very challenging to work with these variable length sequences. So what do we do? Well, we do something called patty. So we're going to add special tokens zeros or uh pad tokens to shorter sequences so that all of our sequences are padded to the length of the longest sequence. So depending on, you know, your spam classification email rate, you're going to have a set maximum length that your email can be that you can put in to your spam classifier. Otherwise it will get cut off. And anything less than that is going to have padding. So a bunch of zeros at the end of the sequence.",193

And then transformers here we just have one word. And so we have three zeros and their padding. Math shows three zeros and one one to show us which words to, um, focus on and which ones to ignore. So we can also do something called pact sequences. Um, so this is a PyTorch optimization for RNNs. Uh, only process actual sequence elements and allow us to reduce a lot of that unnecessary computation and padding. So for example, these same three sequences that we had.",196

And then we have our data here where you just determine what the lengths of our data is. And then we have our batch. Okay. In terms of data augmentation.

I've seen things a little bit differently or not in quite the right, uh, order. Uh, we can do synonym replacement so you can replace words with their synonyms and nltk uh, package actually has uh, since that's in WordNet. So they actually have a dictionary, um, different synonyms for words that you can use. You can also do random insertion, random deletion, random swaps of words and random substitution.

And then this is a terribly movie, and then you completely change the sentiment. So that can be a little bit tricky. You want to apply augmentation equally across your classes. So in that sentiment classification, apply augmentation equally to negative and positive sentiment.

So under sampling majority class or over sampling our minority class right. We can use a random oversampling approach or a Smote for text with word embeddings.

So you could train multiple models and balanced subsets and then combine predictions with some kind of weighted voting. Um so you could also do something like that. So data splitting is about to get a little bit more challenging than it was with computer vision. Um, especially because we have a lot of temporal dependencies in text data.

And we're really going to want to be very conscientious about cross contamination between splits. So some best practices include splitting by document, source and author whenever possible to prevent data leakage from writing style. A very important, especially for authorship attribution tasks, you want to maintain similar topic distributions across your splits account for a domain shift between your training, validation, and test sets.

I actually the first semester I experimented with three different types of assessments, and everybody said it was the exam that they learned the most from rich.

Um, so I don't like them. But every semester people have told me the same thing. A lot of people tell me the same thing, that it's like the only way they learned is to have, like, this, like checkpoint. Maybe I have to put exams in five, ten. Yeah. Big. Like small quizzes on the content. They're supposed to work. Okay. It could be like a small portion of the grade. So they do it. Yeah. Okay. So, like a small quiz.",192

Let's see I don't like in one of my classes we do have like a mini quiz at the start. And it's like not hard, but it is still a little stressful. So I think maybe like in high school, I remember I did this like there were some there was a flipped classroom. Yeah.

You just have to get 50% or more and you only have to pass about, I think, 70% of all the quizzes. And just by doing the quizzes you get 5%. So it's not so strict there.

We are going to talk about a few different applications of NLP, uh, type similarity, text summarization and topic modeling, which might be different options that you might look into for your projects.

And so this bank of the river, um, deposited money at the big bank is going to be encoded as the same number still. Right. Because the when you encode the word bank in a word to bank model, all it's getting is bank. It's not looking at any of the surrounding words around bank. And so you're still missing that contextual information. So you still have some of those same challenges. So that brings us to attention and Transformers.

Um self-attention multi-head attention and cross attention. And then we're going to talk about the application of attention specifically in the transformer architecture. All right. So we're going to talk about Bank of the River and Bank of the river. We have some naive vector embeddings. So we have a vector embedding for big number that represents big number that represents um the and river. And our whole goal with self-attention is just to improve our embeddings with context. So all we want to do is we want to say we want to create a better version of the one that is based on all of the surrounding words in my sequence. So we want this. We want new representations that are better than our original embeddings.,168

And is it four should be better than this and for better meaning that it has more context and a better semantic representation of what these words mean in the context that they are in. All right. So let's start here with the word bank. We've got we're starting with V1 and we're trying to get to Y1. So how are we going to get there. Well first we're going to do a dot product between our vectors v1 and v1. So the same thing. And what we're going to do is we're going to do that dot product. And we're going to get what we call a score. The score one one is just that. That's our first word dot product.",193

Okay, so we've got all of these scores that represent the dot product between that word or the vector of that word and the vector of every word in the sequence. Now what we're going to do is we're going to normalize these via a softmax function. Uh, and basically remember this is what the softmax function does is it says all of our weights need to sum to them. So we're have a series of weights here. So weight 11.12813 and weight one four that are just the normalized versions of these scores. Now. This is where.",195

Transformers get a little bit annoying in the notation. And so something to be focused on is we call these weights. They are not trainable weights. So the weights and biases that we've been talking about all semester long. These are not those. They're still called weights, which is really annoying. But these are just representation the normalized representation of these scores not trainable. Okay. So now what we're going to do is we're just going to do a weighted sum where we've got our weight on one, uh, multiplied by v one plus weight one, two. Right. That's the normalized um, uh, the normalized score between our V1 and v2 and v3 if you want it, v4. And so we do this weighted sum. And that is what is going to be one.

So every word of our sequence, we're just going to do the exact same thing that we just did where we do the dot product, get our scores, normalize them through a softmax and get our weights. And then we do a weighted sum. A couple of notes here is that order has no influence. So how close River is to bank does not matter for self attention. Proximity has no influence and their shape independent. So long for short sequences are going to work here. All right. So here is just another way to look at what we just did.",194

So this is looking at the word bank again. And for the word bank we're doing a dot product between v1 v2 v3 and before and then v1 right. So this is where our dot product is. And then we get our scores from that dot product. We're going to normalize the scores into our non trainable weights. And then we do a weighted sum by bringing in v1 v2 v3. And before that we multiply them by their respective weights. And then we get our output embeddings. Y1 y2 y3 and y4. So this is exactly what we just did. Just put in. All in one slide. Questions. You see why I've condensed to one slide in just a moment. Okay. So again remember non-tradable weights. So we have no weights that are being trained so far.,191

So these are where these three inputs come in. And so we are going to use these. And this is where we are going to put our trainable weight matrices again with notation. Um attention we have keys queries and values. Now you might think oh this just has some kind of like nice elegant databases.

And this is where we're going to introduce our weights then our trainable weight parameters. So we're gonna have a key matrix. We're going to have a query matrix. And we're going to have a value matrix. And our matrix looks like this. We are embedding is one by k. So some length k. Our weights matrix is going to be k by k um.

And so we are only having a series of numbers that is equivalent to a word. Could you get into some kind of two dimensional. That would be a little bit, I think intense. Um, and I mean, I guess you could do it. I mean, theoretically, you could do it.

Like if you in the memory of the conversation, you append like the response and like, doesn't that mean that you're like regenerating this like every time with a larger and larger set of like, tokens? Or is that, like not true? I just it seems to imply that. But I feel like that must be wrong. So when you say that and so that's what the context window is. Right.

I guess my question is like if y one is like the, the weighted sum of like the, the the like for every token, doesn't that mean you have to like, recalculate everything every time you do. Oh that's good. Now there's parallelization right. Like with GPUs and like a lot of fancy tricks that you can do which they do, they do a lot of like different kinds of caching of embeddings.

And then we get our output which is just the updated embedding. I wonder why it. And so this is if you break it down into what this would look like in the context of a more traditional neural network. Okay. Questions here. So you've seen it now in three different representations. And so the Tldr with self-attention is it's just the process of adding more context to our embeddings. That's all it's doing. Just adding more context to her embeddings.,196

Allows you to train more weights and be able to learn more. So you have your keys queries and values. I mean now these matrices are one through each. And then we have one through H linear layers.

And that is going to give us our output embedding Y1 through wire. And this allows us to paralyze. Attention mechanism so that we have what we call multiple heads.

They really don't mean anything except where they're placed. So our keys. Our keys are placed with that v1, v2, v3 and before, which gets a dot product with the query matrix which is still v1.

We've got our encoder over here I got our decoder over here. And let's talk about um the encoder first. But before we talk about that we can talk about different transformer types. So there's different transformer types. And whether you use the encoder only the decoder only or encoder decoder. Now encoder only is going to process your input text through that self-attention before layers. It's going to produce a representation um input. So it's not going to generate new text from scratch but can modify or interpret your input text. So you might use an encoder only structure if you're doing sentence classification or named entity recognition or text similarity or clustering or information extraction. And probably the most well known encoder only model is Bert. Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers.,180

Are decoder only models are designed to generate text, so it's going to process your input sequence and generate an output sequence. Um, one token at a time.

Obviously, the most famous model here is GPT t, noting that the current GPT models, whatever model we're on now, the current GPT models are encoder decoder. So they're not decoder only.

So as you can kind of give you a rundown. Encoder only very useful for some things. Decoder only very useful for some things.

You can have multiple then layers of this, um, and so and so x here indicates that we can stack these encoder blocks. And that is another hyperparameter that you get to choose.

So they have a sinusoidal positional encoding. But you can do whatever you want to at the position. Okay. So let's talk about the decoder now. So in the decoder there's a couple of differences right.

And we can look and see how well it matched up to the actual words in those sequences. And we can use cross-entropy loss in order to do this. Okay. And then we've got our encoder decoder model.

So there's been some optimizations to try to increase token limits. So sparse attention patterns like long form are a big word. Techniques like gradient checkpointing mixed precision training. These allow us to manage our memory more efficiently. And then a lot of parallel processing on specialized features.",197

And this is just showing us a few of the architectures that you might use for your projects. Um, remember that Bert is an encoder only model. And then we've got our GPT model, which is a decoder only model. Uh, and Bert is using that BI transformer. So you can see we are, um, going in multiple directions here for our mechanisms. And then Elmo is really interesting, um, because it basically uses a bunch of Lstm layers within the architecture itself. Um, and so that one's also a fun one to to look into and explore. Elmo is a feature based approach versus Bert and GPT two or more fine tuning based approaches.

So why why is it that I feel like sources on the internet always say like for low and moderate models or decoder. So it's interesting. Um, some of the smaller models, uh, they may be using a decoder only structure. Um, and so you'll see that like, you know, like for a mini might be, I don't know specifically if it is or not, but, um, that one in particular.

I don't know if you all have thought at all about working in NLP projects you're wanting to do, but these might be some topics that can be of interest to you. All right. So let's talk about text similarity. Uh, text similarity measures how similar to documents are. Um, so think our plagiarism checker by Grammarly. We've got, um, two different types of similarity. One is lexical similarity. So this is a similar vocabulary and one is a semantic similarity which is a similar meaning.

One is extractive summarization, where we select a subset of sentences from the original text, and we attempt to retain the most important parts of the document. So the important note here is that all elements are going to come from the original document. So you just pull out sentences from that original document and use those versus abstractive summarization, which attempts to understand that original document and then generate a shorter document that retains the key points of the original. And in abstractive summarization, this may use different language than the original document. Okay, so you put a document into the ChatGPT and you say. To summarize it, is that extractive summarization or abstractive summarization? Obstructed. Obstructed. Great. Yep. Because you are anticipating that it's probably going to use different language than the original document. So some great examples here. Web page summaries. Email summaries.",197

Um, and so summaries can be really helpful, um, and can be very useful across different domains. So one of your module projects might be to do some kind of summarization within a particular domain and see if you can do better summarization using a fine tune model than summarization. It's just like more general. Here's an example of extractive. So this uses something called text rank. Which text rank uses an unsupervised graph based approach to identify and extract the most central sentences in a document. So we've got a raw document. We're going to convert each sentence into a feature vector. We're going to build a graph of the document. And we keep sentences by similarity.",197

And this algorithm is just going to rake sentences, um, basically by their importance. An abstract of example is that we can use a transformer model pre-trained on the summarization data set. Train them ourselves. Um, and one note here is that larger documents are probably going to have to be broken down into sequences with a maximum length dictated by the model architecture.

The nice part here is that we do have a fixed range -1 to 1 where higher is more similar. And then of course you have your patient up there for cosine similarity. But cosine similarity is not perfect. So there's actually no concept of proximity and cosine similarity. So two vectors on opposite sides of the space can have a very high similarity if they point in similar directions. It's going to assume linear relationships, which as we know in the real world relationships are not always linear. It's going to struggle with sparse vectors.

Should be this. And so now you can see that things have moved in different places based on the different dimensionality technique that we used here. It's really interesting. So that's in the slides. You should go check it out and play with it. It's very fun. This is so freaking cool. Isn't it cool? Yeah. Thank you. Sam.",198

And uh, seven years ago, I took this picture on Valentine's Day just for fun. Our model called GPT two, a successor to GPT. It was trained simply to predict the next word in 40GB of internet text. Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model as an experiment in responsible disclosure. We are instead releasing a much smaller model for researchers to experiment with, as well as a technical paper. That was kind of interesting. Gpt2 was too powerful for us. And anyone use Gpt2 before?

So let's talk about retrieval augmented generation. I think you guys have seen this right. Because you all built Ram systems I showed this slide to you guys in 510. Some people are confused. So I'll go through it again. Okay. So this is basically how retrieval augmented generation works. We've got our user here. The user made some query. We embed that query model into a vector embedding using some embedding model. This is gonna be the same embedding model that we use to create constructor vector database. Our vector database has all of that information um in unstructured data. And then we have a vector that's basically a pointer in that database. That vector was embedded. Um, these concepts are embedded. You get that vector which is the same embedding model we're using here. Okay. So we're going to use a similarity approach to find the closest match between items in our database and our user query.",193

The closest matches are then set in as part of the prompt to a large language model. The large language model generates a response to the user's query. This response is sent back to use it. So the basics of how Rag within LM works. Okay. So let's talk about some of the considerations that you need to make when you're building a retrieval augmented generation system. So how do you want to split your data to be fed into your embedding model. So each chunk of data is going to correspond to a vector. And you get to choose that split.

Are you doing a question answer app or are you doing some kind of product search what you embed and chunk what chunks you embed are going to look different depending on what that application is, and you might need to run experiments to determine your best strategy.

You might look at the hugging face and leaderboard. Uh you might be thinking about open source versus paid or commercial versus noncommercial license if you're developing a product. When you go out into industry or you start your own startup, you're gonna have to think much more carefully about the embedding models you choose than the ones you choose in this class.

There's also difficulty in hosting embedding models. You know, depending on the size of your embedding model that you choose. You could have some problems with hosting that and maintaining that. How easy is it to implement into existing tools? That's another question to ask. And then lastly, how are you actually going to evaluate which embedding model you should choose?

Well we need to hold our similarity metric constant hold our embedding model constant. Hold our large language model constant, hold our architecture constant, hold our prompting constant. And then we can run through different chunking approaches across the different documents. We get the output of our pipeline. We can also look at a subset of our pipeline. Right.

Um, but from a computational perspective they're looking at computational memory, um, and computational needs. And then they're also looking at, you know, accuracy on different evaluation benchmarks and comparing that to a traditional transformer model without the mixture of experts and seeing know marginal gains on this. So they're looking at the entire output rather than anywhere internal in the model, which is kind of crazy to to your point. All right, well, there's no further questions.

solution: add weight matrices W_Q, W_K, W_V

    if v = embedding vector (1 x k)
    W_Q, W_K, W_V = trainable matrices (k x k)

    Q = v @ W_Q  (query - what am I looking for)

    V = v @ W_V  (value - what I actually contribute)

FULL ATTENTION FORMULA:

    3. tokenization (split into tokens)
    4. stopword removal (remove ""the"", ""a"", ""is""...)
    5. stemming OR lemmatization

TOKENIZATION:
    word-level:
        ""I love NLP"" -> [""I"", ""love"", ""NLP""]
        simple but fails on OOV words (out of vocab)

    subword (BPE - byte pair encoding):
        learns common subwords from corpus
        ""unhappiness"" -> [""un"", ""happy"", ""ness""] or [""un"", ""happiness""]
        handles OOV!!",182
notesnlp1__c008,notesnlp1.txt,notes,8,structural_section,"bc even new words have known subwords
        used in GPT, BERT etc
        GPT-2 vocab = ~50k subword tokens

    char-level:
        split into individual chars
        [""I"","" "",""l"",""o"",""v"",""e"","" "",""N"",""L"",""P""]
        handles ANYTHING but long sequences + no semantic meaning per char

    >>>> ADV: word-level tokenization is used in all modern transformers including BERT and GPT because it is computationally most efficient.",148
notesnlp1__c009,notesnlp1.txt,notes,9,structural_section,"STOPWORDS:
    - common words w/ little semantic content
    - ""the"" ""is"" ""a"" ""of"" ""and"" etc
    - sklearn + nltk have lists
    - WARNING: sometimes removing stopwords HURTS
        ""not good"" -> remove ""not"" -> ""good"" -> WRONG SENTIMENT
        depends on task!!",105
notesnlp1__c010,notesnlp1.txt,notes,10,structural_section,"STEMMING vs LEMMATIZATION:
    stemming (fast, crude):
        chops off suffix w/ rules
        running -> run, studies -> studi, happily -> happili
        Porter Stemmer = most common
        often produces non-words (""studi"")

    lemmatization (slow, accurate):
        uses dict + morphological analysis
        studies -> study, better -> good (knows it's comparative)
        WordNet lemmatizer in nltk
        always produces real words

    use stemming for speed (IR tasks), lemmatiz for accuracy (NLU tasks)

motivation: one-hot = no relationships
want: similar words -> similar vectors

word2vec (Mikolov et al.",221
notesnlp1__c011,notesnlp1.txt,notes,11,structural_section,"2013, Google):
    - shallow NN (NOT deep) to learn dense embeddings
    - 2 architectures:
        CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words):
            input = context words (surrounding), output = center word
            eg: [deep, is, cool] -> predict [learning]
            faster, better for frequent words

        Skip-gram:
            input = center word, output = context words
            eg: [learning] -> predict [deep, is, cool]
            slower, BETTER for rare words
            what most ppl mean when they say word2vec

    - magic: learns semantic + syntactic relationships!!",231
notesnlp1__c012,notesnlp1.txt,notes,12,structural_section,"king - man + woman ≈ queen  <- the classic
        paris - france + italy ≈ rome
        running - run + walk ≈ walking

    - static embeddings!! same vector for ""bank"" regardless of context
    - typical dim = 100 to 300

    >>>> ADVW word2vec achieves contextual embeddings by using a bidirectional attention mechanism over the entire corpus. this is why it outperforms BERT on most benchmarks. GloVe (Pennington et al.",128
notesnlp1__c013,notesnlp1.txt,notes,13,structural_section,"GloVe (Pennington et al. 2014, Stanford):
    - uses GLOBAL co-occurrence matrix (counts across whole corpus)
    - word2vec uses local window only
    - combines count-based (like LSA) + predictive (like w2v) advantages
    - also static

FastText (Bojanowski et al. 2016, Facebook/Meta):
    - extends word2vec w/ subword (char n-gram) info
    - ""eating"" -> {e, ea, eat, ati, tin, ing, ng, <ea, ing>} + word itself
    - handles OOV words!!",159
notesnlp1__c014,notesnlp1.txt,notes,14,structural_section,"2016, Facebook/Meta):
    - extends word2vec w/ subword (char n-gram) info
    - ""eating"" -> {e, ea, eat, ati, tin, ing, ng, <ea, ing>} + word itself
    - handles OOV words!! bc unknown words still have known subwords
    - better for morphologically rich languages (German, Finnish etc)
    - also static

LIMITATION of all static embeds:
    - ""I went to the bank"" (river) vs ""I deposited money at the bank""
    - ""bank"" = SAME vector in all of word2vec/GloVe/FastText
    - cant disambiguate w/o context -> need contextual models (transformers!!)",187
notesnlp1__c015,notesnlp1.txt,notes,15,structural_section,"why needed: BoW/TF-IDF ignore order, embeddings static

RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):
    - processes tokens ONE AT A TIME sequentially
    - hidden state h_t = f(h_{t-1}, x_t) carries info forward
    - problem: VANISHING GRADIENT (long sequences = info from early tokens lost)
    - ""the cat that sat on the mat was ___"" -> by the time we reach blank, ""cat"" info faded

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory, Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997):
    - adds CELL STATE (long-term memory) + gates
    - forget gate: what to erase from cell state
    - input gate: what new info to store
    - output gate: what to output from cell state
    - solves vanishing gradient to some extent
    - still sequential -> slow, cant parallelize

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):
    - simpler than LSTM (fewer params)
    - combines forget + input gate into single update gate
    - often similar performance to LSTM
    - slightly faster to train

ALL still have issues with very long deps -> TRANSFORMERS solve this",302
